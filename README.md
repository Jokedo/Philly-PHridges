# Philly-Phridges
LaunchCode Final Project locating Community Fridges in Philadelphia

Mission Statement

Philly Phridges aims to act as a living document for community fridges in the Philadelphia region. By implementing Google Maps API, Philly Phridges will provide an interactive map displaying each community fridge in Philadelphia, along with the pertinent contact information for users to find out more about their nearest fridge. Additional information about how to donate to existing fridge sponsors or how to become a fridge sponsor yourself can be found in our Links section.
